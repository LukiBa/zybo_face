This is the thesis template of the ICT/SoC, initially created by
Christian Krieg in October 2018.

In the template, there are three variants of the title page:

	1. Doctoral Thesis
	2. Master's Thesis
	3. Bachelor's Thesis
	4. Report

Un-comment the correct title page, and also to update all relevant data on page two:

	1. BibTeX key, year, month fields
	2. Contact e-mail
	3. If desired, the license under which the thesis/report will be published

This thesis/report template uses biber, to build the thesis/report run:
	
	pdflatex main.tex
	biber main.bcf
	pdflatex main.tex
